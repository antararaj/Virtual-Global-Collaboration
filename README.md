The team collaborated effectively by combining skills from the University of Mirpurkhas and Virginia Tech.

UoM students worked on machine learning models, training Linear Regression and Decision Tree regressors and interpreting performance metrics.

VT students focused on data visualization and provided clear graphs that helped us understand trends in the dataset.

Together, we organized the notebook using the QAC structure to clearly show our questions, analysis steps, and conclusions.

We learned how combining data visualization with machine learning gives a deeper understanding of the dataset.

Working across cultures also helped us appreciate different communication styles and academic perspectives, making the project richer and more enjoyable.
